# GNN-Academic-Citation-Networks
Data Analysis and Prediction on Academic Citation Networks By various GNN models as:
Graph Attention Network (GAT)
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)
Fuesed Model - GAT conv into GCN conv into another GAT conv
Mixed Model - GAT, GCN and GIN outputs concatenate into fully connected layer.

The dataset file is the class of the dataset.
The predict file is the all code of the prediction and the data analysis.
